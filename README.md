# Invoice Creator

## Objectives

The goal of this project was to simulate an e-commerce app where the user can select services and have an invoice generated with total charges. I was to match design specifications from a Figma file, and provide interactivity with buttons to add the cost of services to the invoice as well as the option to remove individual services or reset the form

## My stack

I used HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript in this project, and the design specs came from a Figma file. 

## Accomplishments

The design was not too challenging to accomplish, and while I didn't build this with a mobile-first approach I did add code that would allow the app to be viewed at different screen sizes.


## Challenges

Adding the code to remove one service at a time proved challenging. I would think that I had it, but had to go back to the drawing board a few times. It was rewarding to be able to get that feature functioning, and I know I'll be using it in future projects.

## Things to revisit

I want to make sure that this app is fully accessible and plan to revisit the code to make sure I am using semantic HTML appropriately and that interactive elements change state as needed.
